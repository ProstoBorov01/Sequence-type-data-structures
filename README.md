The project is a set of implementations of dynamic data structures. It includes the following components:

~ A deck (twoâ€”way queue) is a data structure that represents a sequence of elements into which you can add and remove elements from both the beginning and the end.
~ A stack is a data structure that is a sequence of elements into which you can add and remove elements from only one end (usually called the top of the stack).
~ Segmented deck is a modification of the deck, which allows you to divide it into several independent segments to improve the efficiency of working with large amounts of data.
~ A queue is a data structure that represents a sequence of elements into which you can add elements only from one end (called the tail of the queue), and delete them only from the other end (called the head of the queue).
~ A doubly linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of elements, each of which contains links to the previous and next list item

These data structures and algorithms can be useful in solving various programming tasks such as data processing, system modeling, game development, etc.
